# The SLUMS of Quake
A look inside my creation of a city like map on Quake.

## Summary
This Git follows my path and steps taken to creating a level in Quake. Grabbing inspiration from designs from games like Valorant, I am creating a two-to-four player competetive multiplayer level for Quake named Slums(Working Title possibly). The inspirations are derived from the map Split from Valorant, and crafting a level revolving around the left lane of the map as well as inspiration of the flow and each path leading back to another piece of the map and allowing for great game flow in matches. I have two main floors, a sewer type floor as well as a more city scape map, with players traversing around buildings and able to go up stairs to a haven, where they are rewarded with weapons for exploring.
